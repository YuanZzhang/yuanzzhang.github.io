Hi, this is Gabriel Zhang! I am a passionate **_data detective_** with hands-on experience in data science team projects.

Why **_data detective_**? I love reading Sherlock Holmes! I appreciate his ability to unravel mysterious cases through the observation of subtle clues and making shrewd deductions. In the era of big data, I am dedicated to bridging business needs with technical expertise and business acumen to unearth valuable insights from complex datasets, ultimately utilizing data to support evidence-based decisions.

Currently, I am pursuing the [Master of Science in Machine Learning and Data Science (MLDS)](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/machine-learning-data-science) program at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). It's an amazing journey to learn from exceptional professors and collaborate with cohort students.

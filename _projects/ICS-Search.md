### Quick Summary
A scalable and efficient web search engine was developed and implemented using Python. An index with caching on over 55,000 web pages (crawled in 2020) under the Information and Computer Science (ICS) subdomain was constructed to improve query response times. The project also included the design and deployment of a user-friendly web interface using Flask and Azure Web Apps.

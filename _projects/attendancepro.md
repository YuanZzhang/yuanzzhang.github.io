AttendancePro is a web-based authorization system to facilitate a secure check-in/check-out process for children. In addition, it also supports various administrative tasks for the children's ministry at the [Irvine Canaan Christian Community Church](https://www.icccc.org/).

As a web developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing web pages for check-in and check-out procedures as well as information management tools using the [amis](https://baidu.github.io/amis/zh-CN/docs/index) framework, Flask (Python), REST APIs, and Docker. I also integrated a label printer via SDK to print out barcode tags for authentication purpose.

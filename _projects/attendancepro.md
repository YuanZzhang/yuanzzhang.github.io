A web-based information system was developed and implemented to support the children's ministry at the Irvine Canaan Christian Community Church. As a front-end developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing web pages for check-in and check-out procedures for parents and children, as well as information management for teachers. The goal of this system was to enhance safety measures within the ministry.

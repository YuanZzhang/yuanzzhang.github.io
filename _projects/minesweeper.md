An intelligent agent was implemented in Python to solve the Minesweeper game, achieving an accuracy of 70% on intermediate boards (16x16 boards with 40 mines). The model checking method was optimized using a recursive backtracking algorithm, resulting in an average running time reduction of 79% across 100 games.
